Dec \textquotesingle{}18 & \textbf{Deep Image Prior}, \sl{Python} \\ 
Sept \textquotesingle{}18 & \footnotesize{A technical study on Image restoration techniques without using CNNâ€™s. We show a randomly initialized neural network is sufficient to capture low-level image statistics which can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in standard inverse problems and invert deep neural representations to diagnose and restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\

Jun '18 & \textbf{Simulator Scheduling}, \sl{Python} \\
Apr '18 & \footnotesize{A comprehensive study on process scheduling in a Linux operating system. We compared a few scheduling algorithms to the Completely Fair Scheduler used by the Linux kernel.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

Mar \textquotesingle{}18 & {\textbf{Sliding Tiles}} {\sl Android, Java}  \\
Jan \textquotesingle{}18 & \footnotesize{Classic version of the n-Puzzle problem adapted for cellphones. A single or double player game with an option of playing to form a 1-15 sequence or assemble equations, from a randomized puzzle set. This android application can be played over Bluetooth or WiFi}\\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\

Dec \textquotesingle{}17 & {\textbf{Baseball Library}} {\sl JavaScript, Express.js, Bootstrap, Postman}\\
Sept \textquotesingle{}17 & \footnotesize{A web application that filters information about baseball players from an online repository.

The request is filtered from a PostgreSQL database. The API\textquotesingle{}s were tested using Postman.}\\ \multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\

Apr \textquotesingle{}15 & {\textbf{MovieGram}} {\sl Java, Android, Ubuntu OpenStack Server}\\
Aug \textquotesingle{}14 & \footnotesize{Basically Netflix, if it were on a private scale The android application streams files hosted from a personal server. Video streaming codes were added as well. The server was built on the open source Ubuntu OpenStack Server. A comprehensive study went in comparing video codes to minimize the loss during transmission.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\

Jan \textquotesingle{}14 & {\textbf{MyFilofax}} {\sl Java, Android}\\
Sept \textquotesingle{}13 & \footnotesize{Built to organize a student\textquotesingle{}s workload. The application keeps track of assignments due and reminds of the deadline. A simple poll monitors the attendance and notifies if low. Also features a portal that connects to Blackboard, acts as a means to submit homework from mobile devices.}\\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\

&{\textbf{Other Projects}}\\
&\footnotesize{General Purpose Universal Kiosks, case study on Interaction Design. Snakes, the classic arcade game, ported using C++ and a Library Management System in Java as a refresher.}\\%\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\
